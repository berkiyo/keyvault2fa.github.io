        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. Data Collection</h2>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">No Personal Data Collected</h3>
        <p>
          KeyVault OTP does not collect or store any personal data from its users. All 2FA codes and related data are securely stored in your iCloud account, fully under your control.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Anonymous Usage Data</h3>
        <p>
          We collect limited, non-identifiable information solely to track the number of anonymous users using the App. This data is aggregated and cannot be traced back to any individual user.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Use of Data</h2>
        <p>The anonymous data we collect is used exclusively to:</p>

          <li>Improve the performance, functionality, and reliability of the App.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4">We do not sell, share, or transmit any user data to third parties.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          Since KeyVault OTP does not transmit personal data, there is no risk of your personal information being shared or accessed by unauthorized parties. The limited anonymous data collected is securely processed in compliance with applicable laws.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          KeyVault OTP relies on Apple's iCloud services to store and synchronize your 2FA codes across your devices. By using the App, you also agree to Apple's iCloud Terms and Policies. Any data you manage through the App remains under your control and is not shared externally by us.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. User Control and Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          As the App operates in conjunction with iCloud, you have full control over the data you process. We do not access or store any of your 2FA codes, files, or personal information. Your data remains encrypted and secure within Apple's ecosystem.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect improvements in the App or changes in legal requirements. Any updates will be communicated by revising the Effective Date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the App indicates your acceptance of any changes.
